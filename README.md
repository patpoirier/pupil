# pupil
Pupil is an open source peer-to-peer tutoring platform. This means students will be able to use the platform to tutor other students.

Pupil will integrate some optional modules from Erudite Science, such as AI-powered computer assisted feedback.

Schools who do not want to administer their own hosting and instance of Pupil, can register with Erudite Science to take advantage of hosting and customer support services.

Pupil is currently under development using MongoDB, Javascript, Node.js, and HTML. However, additional technologies for messaging queues and highly scalable architecture will be selected and integrated.
